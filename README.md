# SeniorResearch

My repo for 2019-2020 TJ Computer Systems Research! All senior research files will go here.

### Journals
The journals that I turned in every week in class go into this folder. They include my progress, what I learned that week, and my future goals.

### Project
All the files that are associated with my actual question answering project (as opposed to files I created for my online class) will end up in this folder.

### Stanford Class
These are all the documents from an online class I followed through Stanford that teaches natural langugae processing with deep learning. The course is called CS224n, and their web page contains all the course notes. All the lecture videos (about 1.5 hrs each) are on YouTube. This is where I learned all the foundational material for my project, such as word embeddings, text generation/prediction, and types of recurrent neural networks.
